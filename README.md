# SU-NOTES
Part of our T.E MiniProject in which we made an E-learning app for Shivaji University Engineering Students

## The name of our project is “SU-NOTES”. The project is based on Android application using JAVA and XML.
The main aim of this project is to introduce the mobile learning based information by means of Android. 
Mobile learning as an intersection of Mobile Computing and E-Learning providing resources that can be accessed anywhere has capability in an excellent searching system, rich interaction and full support towards an effective Learning and performance based assessment.
The application of mobile learning can be used through the android operating system that is chosen in consideration to that Android has been dominating the Smartphone market and is an open-source operating system that is easily developed.

## I have added the apk file inside the ApkFile folder which is inside the root folder of the repo for testing purpose.

## Also, i have added the official documentation of our project inside the root directory with the name SU_NOTES_FINAL_REPORT.pdf.
## P.S. - Currently our app has notes and the support only for the Computer Science Engineering Department but I will soon be adding the notes and the support for the remaining branches.
My plan in future is to bridge the gap betweeen students and the faculty and so any faculty interested to provide their notes can come to me and contact me on my email id- vikram7111997@gmail.com
